<h1>Unit 1</h1>

<p>The first unit of the year that took place, no surprise to some, is Unit 1 - The Online World.</p>

<p>Unit 1 was an exam based unit, which was filled with plenty of revision sessions and short tasks to be completed throughout the lesson.</p>
<p>We usually spent 4 hours a week working on Unit 1, with an hour on a Monday and 3 hours on a Thursday.</p>
<p>This unit focused on a few different topics as part of a whole, including online services and their applications, file compression and its pros and cons.</p>
<p>Additionally, I dug deep into cloud computing, email and data exchange, which made me aware of things I hadn't considered before while using these services, and has affected my choices overtime.</p>
<p>I also gained knowledge about potential computer threats associated with internet use. I was able to obtain a Level 1 pass in this Unit.</p>
