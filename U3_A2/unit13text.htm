<h1>Unit 13 Context</h1>

<p>This is the page showcasing the context page for Unit 13 - Website Development. </p>

<p>Unit 13 was an assignment based unit, which was filled with short tasks and three assignments to be completed throughout the lessons we had. This was the first assignment based unit that we worked on, from September onwards.</p>
<p>Throughout Unit 13, we had 4 assignments which were all related to learning about websites, designing websites, developing a website and reviewing said website.</p>
<p>Below, I have linked a video of my page and what it leads to. There are 8 pages all together which link together to form the small website; each one giving information about different products or the company itself.</p>
<p>I chose quite a basic theme but for good reason. For those users who may have visual impairments, black text on a white background is the most common combination for what people with a sort of visual impairment may use.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain a Pass in this Unit following 3 months of work.</p>
