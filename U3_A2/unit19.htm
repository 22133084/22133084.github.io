<h1>Unit 19</h1>

<p>This is the page showcasing Unit 19 - Computing in the Workplace. </p>

<p>Unit 19 is about applying for jobs in the IT sector and is split into two key sections: applying for a job and social media in the workplace. This unit helps you understand the crucial steps involved in securing an IT role and how to manage your professional online presence.</p>
<p>This unit focuses on essential aspects of career development in the IT industry, including creating effective CVs and cover letters, understanding interview techniques, and exploring the impact and appropriate use of social media in a professional context.</p>
<p>We typically spend time each week working on Unit 19, focusing on both theoretical knowledge and practical application.</p>
<p>All of these tasks and learning points contribute to a comprehensive understanding of navigating the IT job market and maintaining a professional digital footprint. The unit will equip you with the skills to confidently apply for roles and understand the etiquette of online professional interaction.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain a Pass in this Unit following 2 months of work.</p>
