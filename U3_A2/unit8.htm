<h1>Unit 8</h1>

<p>This is the page showcasing Unit 8 - Mobile App Development. </p>

<p>Unit 8 was an assignment based unit, which was filled with short tasks and three assignments to be completed throughout the lessons we had.</p>
<p>We usually spent 5 hours a week working on Unit 8, with an hour and a half on a Monday and 3 and a half hours on a Friday. In my opinion, this was not much time for the amount of work we actually had involved.</p>
<p>This unit focused on mobile applications, including designs, functionalities, requirements and accessibility options.</p>
<p>All of these small tasks would then lead onto the main assignment, which is building a mobile app from scratch. The app was for 3-7 year olds, teaching them the first 6 letters of the alphabet (A-F).</p>
<p>I was able to obtain a Pass in this Unit following 3 months of work.</p>
