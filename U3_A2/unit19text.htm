<h1>Unit 19</h1>

<p>This is the page showcasing Unit 19 - Computing in the Workplace. </p>

<p>Unit 19 is about applying for jobs in the IT sector and is split into two key sections: applying for a job and social media in the workplace. This unit helps you understand the crucial steps involved in securing an IT role and how to manage your professional online presence.</p>
<p>Throughout Unit 19, we had 3 assignments which were all related to learning about, well, computing in the workplace and the world of work in general. We learned about characteristics of employees, how to apply for a job (including a digital cover letter and resume), and how a workplace utilises technology for their work.</p>
<p>Below, I have added a few links to pieces of work I have created across this Unit.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain a Pass in this Unit following 2 months of work.</p>
