<h1>Unit 2</h1>

<p>This is the page showcasing Unit 2 - Technology Systems. </p>

<p>Unit 2 was an exam based unit, which was filled with plenty of revision sessions and short tasks to be completed throughout the lessons we had.</p>
<p>We usually spent 4 hours a week working on Unit 2, with an hour on a Monday and 3 hours on a Thursday. We started working on Unit 2 after we completed our Unit 1 exam.</p>
<p>This unit focused on a few different topics as part of a whole, including transferring data, computer factors and input,output devices.</p>
<p>Additionally, I learnt a lot of new information about computer components, how they work, how different systems work similarly yet differently and how these are tested.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain a Level 1 pass in this Unit.</p>
