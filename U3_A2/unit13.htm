<h1>Unit 13</h1>

<p>This is the page showcasing Unit 13 - Website Development. </p>

<p>Unit 13 was an assignment based unit, which was filled with short tasks and three assignments to be completed throughout the lessons we had. This was the first assignment based unit that we worked on, from September onwards.</p>
<p>We usually spent 5 hours a week working on Unit 13, with an hour and a half on a Monday and 3 and a half hours on a Friday. </p>
<p>This unit focused on mostly websites, including designs, functionalities, requirements and accessibility options.</p>
<p>All of these small tasks would then lead onto the main assignment, which is building a website from scratch using HTML and JavaScript. The website was designed as an online reference site for mobile phones and accessories, directing users to the online stores and explaining some mobile devices and their features.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain a Pass in this Unit following 3 months of work.</p>
